# **# The colony's biome changes every 60 days. (can edit in option)**

- Tile, Animals, plants, temperature change
- Not destroy : Constructed floors, buildings, anima trees, sea, river, water(option)

# **# No lag**

- It runs smoothly with no lag.
- Biomes! mod series may cause more lag than other mods when changing.
- If you are experiencing lag, change the 'change tick' in the options to a larger number. (Instead, Map tiles take longer to change.)


# **# The entire map changes over about 12 days**

- This is a real play capture.
